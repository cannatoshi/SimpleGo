### [Verse 1]

Binary rivers flowing through the wire
ESP32 burning like electric fire
Haskell code we never had to see
Reverse engineering sets the protocol free

Fourteen bugs deep in the machine
Crypto layers no one's ever seen
HSalsa20 hiding in the dark
Every byte we trace leaves its mark

---

### [Chorus]

We are the first - native on the wire
Breaking through the noise - climbing ever higher
No wrapper no API - just the raw connection
SimpleGo rising - hardware resurrection

---

### [Verse 2]

X448 keys in little-endian hell
wolfSSL secrets we had to compel
Three AM debugging Poly1305
Every tag mismatch keeping us alive

Server says OK but the app says no
A_CRYPTO errors everywhere we go
Layer after layer we strip it down
Until the breakthrough finally comes around

---

### [Chorus]

We are the first - native on the wire
Breaking through the noise - climbing ever higher
No wrapper no API - just the raw connection
SimpleGo rising - hardware resurrection

---

### [Bridge]

Evgeny said amazing
The world said impossible
But we kept tracing
Every byte responsible

Double Ratchet spinning
AES-GCM in the night
ESP32 winning
First native taking flight

---

### [Verse 3]

Contact appears on the mobile screen
Cleanest handshake that you've ever seen
From Berlin basement to the protocol throne
First external implementation - standing alone

Reply Queue decrypting piece by piece
Seventeen bugs and we still won't cease
Hardware messenger breaking the mold
This is the story that had to be told

---

### [Outro Chorus]

We are the first - circuits on fire
No one believed - now we climb higher
SimpleGo protocol - pure dedication
First native SMP - new generation

---

### [Fade]

Zero to one... native on the wire...
Zero to one... SimpleGo...
